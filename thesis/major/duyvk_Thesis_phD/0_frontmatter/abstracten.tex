Time series analysis and forecasting has been one of the hot-concerned topics to many data scientists and economists since last few decades. It helps to predict future values based on values both at present and in the past. At first, they ultilize statistical methods to figure out the approximate models underlying time series then use that models to predict. Recently, time series forecasting is also solved easily using modified and adaptive machine learning techniques.

According to available data and the efficient of the recent modern techniques, we take the advantages of a traditional statistical method named "ARIMA"(Auto-Agressive Integrated Moving Average Model) based on iterative Box-Jenkins procedure. We also use Artificial Neural Networks accompanying to 2 training methods: Back Propagation  and Genetic Algorithm. Both of them are applied to solve univariate time series prediction problem on traffic-forecasting on telecommunication tunel network, specifically, GTEL telecom network in Vietnam. According to the results, the artificial neural networks produce the better predicted results with smaller Symmetric mean absolute percentage error ($sMAPE = 2.975\%-3.092\%$) compared to ARIMA's ($sMAPE=5.34\%$) and its other measures are also more optimistic.
