It is hard to get information about underlying formal models
used by current commercial systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7].
Each system seems to use a different model, and the query
results that they generate are not easy to compare. Jain et

commercial systems, Oracle CEP and StreamBase. They
only consider the way that window execution is triggered.
Though an important first step, this work focuses on only
one aspect of execution behavior (i.e., Tick in SECRET),
just one of the aspects our model captures and explains
